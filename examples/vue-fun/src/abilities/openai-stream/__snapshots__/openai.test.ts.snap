1.  **Save the code:** Open a text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or any code editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom). Copy and paste the line \`print("Hello, World!")\` into the editor. Save the file with a \`.py\` extension, for example, \`hello.py\`.

2.  **Open your terminal/command prompt:**
    *   **Windows:** Search for "cmd" or "PowerShell" in the Start menu.
    *   **Mac/Linux:** Search for "Terminal" in your applications.

3.  **Navigate to the directory:** Use the \`cd\` command to go to the directory where you saved your \`hello.py\` file. For example, if you saved it in a folder called \`my_python_programs\` on your desktop, you might type:
    \`\`\`bash
    cd Desktop/my_python_programs
    \`\`\`

4.  **Run the program:** Once you're in the correct directory, type:
    \`\`\`bash
    python hello.py
    \`\`\`
    (On some systems, you might need to use \`python3\` instead of \`python\` if you have multiple Python versions installed).

### Expected Output:
